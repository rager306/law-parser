# Central index of all specification files with importance hierarchy.
# Used for navigation, validation, and dependency resolution.
#
# IMPORTANT: Legislation hierarchy (spec-101) is the PRIMARY reference.
# All other specs depend on it as the foundation.
#
# Importance levels:
# - critical: Foundation (legislation hierarchy)
# - high: Authority structures, document registries
# - medium: Detailed structures (44-ФЗ specifics)
# - low: Supporting documentation, guides
